        <p><b>Drug companies should ensure early involvement of their regulatory affairs personnel in EU referral procedures to help anticipate possible outcomes and facilitate their smooth implementation. There have been examples recently where the burden of implementing certain referral outcomes such as conducting additional post-authorization studies, has led companies, especially generic manufacturers, to withdraw their marketing authorization rather than comply with the new obligations, reports Vibha Sharma.</b></p><p /><p>When the EU pharmacovigilance legislation came into effect in July 2012, it changed forever the way generic drug companies dealt with referral procedures that are used for resolving concerns around the quality, safety, efficacy or benefit-risk profile of a medicine or a class of medicines.</p><p>Before this, the referral procedure was mostly focused on originator companies. It was not mandatory for generic companies to participate in a referral, nor did they face any legal obligation to complete additional studies imposed following the procedure and they incurred no or minimal costs during the entire process. </p><p>However, all this changed with the advent of the new EU pharmacovigilance legislation under which all marketing authorization holders, including generic companies, are equally affected by referrals. This means that generic companies must now participate in the referral procedure and implement its outcomes, which can include changing the product information, conducting post authorization safety and efficacy studies, and implementing other risk minimization measures.</p><p>"Referrals are a fact of life. Get over it," John Barber, Director of Pharmacovigilance (EU Operations) for Dr Reddy's Laboratories, told companies attending the 9th annual Pharmacovigilance Forum organized by the European Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (EGA) on Jan. 27 in London.</p><p>Barber said that generic companies should now focus their efforts on dealing with referrals in the most efficient way, not just for their own benefit, but also to improve patient safety. He believes that there are lessons to be learnt from the referral procedures completed so far and urged generic companies and regulators to come up with action points to improve the current process.</p><p>Barber cited the example of the safety referral procedure involving domperidone-containing medicines, which was initiated (under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC) in March 2013 by Belgium over the drug's serious cardiac side-effects<sup>1</sup><sup>,2</sup>. </p><p>"The domperidone case is one of the biggest referrals that generic companies have been involved with. It was [a] very complex [case] and threw up a lot of issues that can serve as learning points [for the rest of the industry]," he said.</p><p>The referral resulted in the European Medicines Agency's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee issuing a series of recommendations, which were endorsed by the CMDh (the EU co-ordination group for mutual recognition and decentralized procedures) and adopted by the European Commission in September 2014. As a result, certain conditions were imposed:</p><p>1) <b>Post-authorization studies:</b> All MAHs were asked to collaborate to conduct a post-authorization efficacy study (PAES) to support the drug's pediatric use, and also a post-authorization safety study (PASS)/drug utilization study to gather data on the effectiveness of the risk minimization measures and the drug's off-label use.</p><p>Barber explained that a number of companies that were concerned about the costs associated with conducting the PASS and PAES studies withdrew their marketing authorizations from some EU states. The imposition of such requirements can, therefore, have the unintended consequence of affecting the availability of medicines in some countries, he said. </p><p>Also, the PAES requirement caused confusion among some companies as it was not clear to them whether they had to participate in the PAES study if they didn't have a pediatric indication on their marketing authorization. An EU-wide consortium of the originator (Janssen) and affected generic manufacturers was formed to support the requirement for PAES and PASS studies, but this was a "painful process" as it took a long time to finalize legal agreements between the large number of MAHs. </p><p>Also, the scope of the PASS study was significantly changed from what was originally required. As a result of these issues, the PASS study is yet to start even though the recommendation to do this was issued in 2014, Barber said.</p><p>As for possible solutions, Barber suggested that collaborations between companies to conduct joint PASS/PAES studies can be facilitated by developing a cross-industry template on consortium agreements. Also, he said that the PRAC/CMDh assessment reports should include "very clear recommendations" on what should be included in any post-authorization study so that the scope is not changed midway. </p><p>2) <b>Risk management plans:</b> All MAHs were asked to submit an RMP to concerned national competent authorities within three months of the commission decision. Barber explained that there was confusion among companies regarding the deadline for submitting the RMPs. It was not clear if the three-month submission deadline was to be calculated based on the commission's final decision of September 2014 or on another retrospective date of July 2014.</p><p>In Barber's experience, the assessment of domperidone RMPs by different competent authorities has been "a bit mixed"<sup>3</sup>. He pointed out that RMPs for domperidone have been submitted to Germany's BfArM. "Several months later, [MAHs] got a letter [from BfArM] saying that they were not going to assess it until the Belgian authorities had assessed the innovator's RMP. We are still waiting for the assessment of the RMPs [by BfArM]," he said.</p><p>In such cases, Barber believes "things can be done quickly" if the PRAC/CMDh assessment report on the referral were to include a "core RMP". However, CMDh's Dutch representative Dr Kora Doorduyn-van der Stoep, who also spoke at the EGA conference, clarified that the PRAC or the CMDh would not develop core RMPs as they believe that RMPs should be developed by MAHs themselves. </p><p>Barber said that if "core RMPs" are not possible, then the assessment report should include "very explicit" requirements to make it easier for MAHs to draw out their own RMPs. The domperidone assessment report only included abbreviated requirements for the RMP.</p><p>Alternatively, Doorduyn-van der Stoep suggested the originator company could have a consultation with generic companies on the content of the RMP before submitting a variation application. "We have seen an example of this [approach] for a referral, where there was a consultation between all [concerned] companies so that they could submit more or less the same RMP," she said. </p><p>To facilitate the assessment of RMPs, Barber suggested that this should be done through work sharing so that only one agency assesses all the RMPs on behalf of all national competent authorities "so that we have consistency on those assessments."</p><p>3) <b>MAs revoked and variations:</b> Also, the domperidone referral resulted in marketing authorizations being revoked for certain high-dose formulations and combination products, and labeling changes were needed for all other domperidone-containing medicines pertaining to the drug's use both in adults and children.</p><p /><p><b>Early Involvement Of Regulatory Affairs Personnel Is Key</b></p><p>CMDh's Doorduyn-van der Stoep said the first few referrals that were undertaken by the PRAC after the implementation of the pharmacovigilance legislation, including the domperidone case, should be seen as a learning experience for all parties and the problems presented by these early cases "should not be regarded as the standard norm for all referrals."</p><p>The first few referrals "were difficult and we learnt a lot from them&#8230; The more recent referrals have led to clear conclusions and there has been no confusion or problems with their implementation," she said. However, Doorduyn-van der Stoep acknowledged that there are several issues with respect to older substances &ndash; such as efficacy issues and lack of harmonization of indications &ndash; that have been identified by CMDh during discussions on PRAC referrals and these need to be addressed by all parties.</p><p>Her key message to all drug companies was to ensure early engagement of their regulatory affairs staff with PRAC during the referral process. "In the end, it is your regulatory affairs department that would have to implement the outcomes of the referral procedure so they should provide some input, especially in terms of what is feasible, when the process is on," said Doorduyn-van der Stoep. </p><p>Early engagement of regulatory affairs staff can help MAHs anticipate possible outcomes of the referral procedure and they can use the opportunity to provide input on issues such as feasibility of study timelines before the referral is finalized. "We have seen a lot of requests from drug companies for extension of [study] timelines because it was not possible for them to submit the protocol within the period imposed as a condition to the marketing authorization," said Doorduyn-van der Stoep. </p><p>To help implement the referral outcomes, such as submission of RMPs and conducting post-authorization studies, she suggested that the PRAC could perhaps consider seeking input from all MAHs on matters such as the content of the RMP and feasibility of timelines for studies before finalizing its recommendations on these conditions.</p><p><b>PASS For Generics: Balancing Act</b></p><p>Doorduyn-van der Stoep said that in referrals, where a PASS/drug utilization study is imposed as a condition to the marketing authorization, "it's important to balance [the need for requiring such studies] with the risk of subsequent withdrawal of generic marketing authorizations."</p><p>She said there had been some examples "where PASS was asked as part of the referral and we saw that many generic companies withdrew the concerned indication [from their marketing authorization] because if there is no indication then there is no need for them to conduct a PASS anymore."</p><p>Consortia can help avoid duplication of studies and there have been success stories on this front for valproate<sup>4</sup> and cyproterone acetate/ethinylestradiol, she said. Work sharing on variations is possible for all companies included in a consortium when submitting study results, she added.</p><p><b>EMA Criteria On Applicability Of Conditions To Generics </b></p><p>Separately, the EMA has been holding discussions on the need to ensure that mechanisms are in place for national competent authorities to assess whether any condition imposed on originator medicines should also apply to generic products. </p><p>"In addition to the procedural mechanisms, the agency intends to develop criteria to support the assessment of the applicability of the condition to generic products. These criteria would probably take into consideration aspects such as the nature of the medicine, the objectives and the phase of the study, etc," an EMA spokesperson told <i>Scrip Regulatory Affairs</i>. The issue would be addressed by the EMA through an update to its good pharmacovigilance practice module VIII, which relates to PASS.</p><p>The matter was initially discussed at the organizational matters teleconference in September 2015 in relation to a specific product and led to a broader discussion on the topic<sup>5</sup>. It highlighted the need for a systematic reflection when imposing a PASS on an originator product on the consequences for generics medicines already authorized, under evaluation or to be filed in the coming months or years, and whether there is a scientific rationale for also imposing a PASS on generics.</p><p /><p><i>References</i></p><p>1.
